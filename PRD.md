## 1. Overview

**House of Cohort** is a luxury perfume e-commerce store targeting the Sierra Leone market. It consists of two surfaces:

- **Customer Storefront** — a polished, minimal-luxury shopping experience where customers browse, select, and purchase perfumes.
- **Admin Panel** — an internal tool for store administrators and staff to manage products, inventory, orders, discounts, and delivery logistics.

**Design Aesthetic:** Minimal luxury — black, gold, and white tones. Clean typography, generous whitespace, high-quality product imagery.

**Currency:** SLE (Sierra Leone Leone) exclusively, as required by the Monime payment gateway.

## 7. Payment Integration (Monime)

### 7.1 About Monime
Monime is a Sierra Leone payment platform. Supported payment methods on the hosted checkout:
- Card payments
- Bank transfer (Sierra Leone banks)
- Mobile Money
- Wallet

All amounts are in **SLE minor units** (integer). 1 SLE = 100 minor units. E.g. SLE 25.00 → `2500`.

### 7.2 Checkout Session Flow

```
Customer submits checkout form
    ↓
Server validates cart, delivery zone, and coupon
    ↓
Server creates an Order record in DB with status = PENDING
    ↓
Server calls Monime POST /checkout-sessions
  - name: "House of Cohort Order"
  - lineItems: ordered products with name, SLE price, quantity, image URL
  - successUrl: /checkout/success?orderId=xxx&sid={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}
  - cancelUrl: /checkout?cancelled=true
  - reference: orderId
  - Idempotency-Key header: orderId
    ↓
Server receives { redirectUrl } and returns it to the client
    ↓
Client redirects customer to Monime hosted checkout
    ↓
Customer completes payment on Monime
    ↓
Monime redirects to successUrl
    ↓
Server verifies payment by querying Monime GET /checkout-sessions/:id
  - Confirms status === "completed"
  - Updates Order status → PAID
  - Decrements stock for each ordered variant
    ↓
Customer sees order confirmation page
```

### 7.3 Cancellation & Expiry
- If the customer cancels, Monime redirects to `cancelUrl`. The Order remains `PENDING` and the customer can retry.
- If the Monime session expires, the Order remains `PENDING`. The customer must return to checkout.
- Payment verification always happens server-side by querying the Monime API — client-supplied parameters are never trusted alone.

## 8. Authentication

### 8.1 Providers

| Provider | Used by |
|---|---|
| Google OAuth | Customers — primary sign-in method |
| Credentials (email + hashed password) | Admin and Staff accounts |

### 8.2 Role Enforcement

Middleware runs on all `/admin/*` routes:

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| Unauthenticated | Redirected to `/auth/signin` |
| CUSTOMER | Redirected to `/` (access denied) |
| STAFF | All `/admin/*` except `/admin/staff` and `/admin/discounts` |
| ADMIN | Full access to all admin routes |

Customer-protected routes (`/account/*`, `/wishlist`) redirect unauthenticated users to sign-in.

### 8.3 Guest Cart Merge
When a guest logs in after adding items to cart, the guest cart (keyed by a session cookie) is merged into the authenticated user's cart. Duplicate variants have their quantities combined. The guest cart record is deleted after the merge.

## 11. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Product listing page LCP under 2 seconds on a standard mobile connection
- All product images served via Cloudinary with format optimization and lazy loading
- Database queries use indexed fields (slug, categoryId, userId, status)

### Security
- All admin routes protected server-side via middleware — role check is not client-side only
- Coupon validation and discount calculation are server-side; client totals are never trusted
- Payment verification queries the Monime API server-side; `successUrl` parameters alone are not sufficient proof of payment
- Passwords for credentials accounts are hashed with bcrypt
- All database queries use Prisma's parameterized query system (no raw SQL interpolation)

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first layouts using Tailwind CSS breakpoints
- Storefront fully usable on mobile (375px+)
- Admin panel optimized for desktop; functional on tablet (768px+)

### Accessibility
- shadcn/ui components are ARIA-compliant
- All product images include descriptive alt text
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standard

### Inventory Integrity
- Stock is only decremented after payment is verified as `completed` via the Monime API
- Stock is never decremented at cart addition or order creation
- If stock reaches 0, the variant is displayed as Out of Stock and cannot be added to cart
